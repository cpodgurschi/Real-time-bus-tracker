# Reak Time Bus Tracker
<img src="Real Time Bus Tracker.png" width='100'>
This exercize is showcasing how to add animation to a map. It uses the MBTA bus data to determine stops between Harvard and MIT and it adds an animated marker on the map to highlight the bus routes. Also, it leverages mapbox (an open-source platform that allows to create and display maps on a web page) and mapboxgl JavaScript library to add the marker to the map. 

## Task Description

My task in this activity is twofold:

* **Task 1**: Create a marker and add it to the map using the mapboxgl pre-built functions. Make sure to get the access token from the Mapbox account and add the access token to the mapboxgl instance defined in the mapanimation.js.
* **Task 2**: Then, implement the move() function to move the marker on the map from one bus stop to the next.

 ## Installation

* **Step 1**: Download all documents from the  file: Index.html, eyes.js, README.md files, styles.css, and eyes.png
* **Step 2**: Open the Index.html file

 ## Usage

* **#1** When you open the Index.html file, two eyes should appear on the screen.
* **#2** When you click the button "Show stops between MIT and Harvard", the marker animation starts, and you should see the marker moving from one bus stop to the next on the map.
